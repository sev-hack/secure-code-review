# Secure Code Review

**Secure Code Review** is a systematic examination of an application's source code to identify security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and flaws that could be exploited by attackers. It is a critical practice in SSDLC aimed at detecting and mitigating risks before deployment.

This repo contains:
- Challenges - practice in order to grow your skills
- Methodology - how to perform secure code review

## Challenges

> The challenges below may or may NOT contain vulnerabilities. This is done in order to simulate the real work of an Application Security engineer when performing Secure Code Review :)

> Some code examples were generated by LLM, so don't pay attention to the code quality

> There may be so-called unintended ways, so feel free to report it
